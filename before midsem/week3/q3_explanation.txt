Creating a pipe before forking. Now in the parent, we first close the reading end and then write the string in the write end of the pipe.
In the child thread, we close the writing end of the pipe and read the string from the reading end of the pipe and then print the string.

NOTE: the string printed in the parent is hard coded.
